# Excalidraw Selfhosted

## Goals
The goal of this project is optimize excalidraw for self hosted environments with many concurrent collaborators
focusing on collaboration mode

## How does this
## Technical differences from Excalidraw
- Files and state persistence have moved from firebase to selfhosted server to
  remove size limitations
- Collaboration conflict resolution is not done on the server to reduce traffic
  (removes end to end encryption)
- All loading / saving collaboration sessions happen via the web sockets collab server

## Functional differences from Excalidraw
- Image file size and max resolution has increased 3x
- Max canvas size restrictions removed
- End to End encryption replaced with SSL encryption for data in transit
- Collab sessions with lots of people should reduce less errors because only
  differences are synced now and syncing happens on server
- Any URL link can be embedded now without whitelisting

## TODO
- Implement authentication
- Add back in sync all scene elements, and not just incremental changes
  (might be useful when shutting down collab session in case anything was missed)
- Delete old collab sessions that have not been updated for awhile
- limit collab sessions held in memory.
- backup collab sessions, add ability to create snapshots
-
